My first Repository
This project is my interactive Curriculum Vitae or Resume.
The intent is to allow the user to view portions of the each job description by pressing a button. It makes the initial overall 
resume shorter, avoiding the clunky long resume. I also included a small picture of the product line I was working on during my tenure at each company. This also helps with the job description.

This website is straightforward and is intuitive in its operation.
