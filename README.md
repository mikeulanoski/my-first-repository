# my-first-repository
This project is my interactive Curriculum Vitae or Resume.

The intent is to allow the user to view portions of the each job description by pressing a button. It makes the initial overall resume shorter, avoiding the clunky long resume. I also included a small picture of the product line I was working on during my tenure at each company. This also helps with the job description.

This website is straightforward and is intuitive in its operation.

### Prerequisites

A Github account.


### Installing

You can access my project using the link below:

Once there, download the zip file and unzip it on your computer. Double click on the index.html file and you are there.

```
Once you have opened the file you have the compact version of my Resume. 
You can click the buttons to display each of the job descriptions.
You can also use the slider on the right to display parts of the resume not shown.
The page also has the ability to be shown from narrow (smartphone) display to wide screen display.
